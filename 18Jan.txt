Visual Design
-------------

advanced exam question?
-> usng simplicity and consistency from cognetics and visual design, explain who adaptive interface are good/bad for and why

->features vanish/show up not by our wishes(for dev)
->good for novice they need instructions

simplicity vs consistency :
reduction in options offers simplicity
alternation of the interface causes exceptions to fire in our preattentive systems

Gestalt principles: perceptual organization or intermediate visual processing
->happen below our consciousness
