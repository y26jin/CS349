two states of mind of users

----------------
(As last lecture did not cover many useful topics, I will continue from 16Jan on 21Jan)

direct manipulation != multitouch interaction...

interaction vs interface
--dialog / vehicle of dialog

instrumental interaction
-----------------------

instruments + objs

example of WIMP activations:
-> dialog box...

instruments act on instruments
-> examples -> toolbar -> dialog box
