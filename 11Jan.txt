Basic X windows programming

X windows:
1. X server 
- provide services for client application to render, draw, mesh, etc...

2. X lib
- client

some resources store on x server
x server batches messages (XFlush command push messages out)

Xlib
so that ppl can avoid reinventing wheels
no common look and feel when implementing with xlib
no GUI toolkits --> flexible

client-init events: user inits ??? e.g. mouse click,move, keyboard events...

':0' -- open display 

stroke model: device specific?
region model: 

when u start to draw, routines use same sets of patterns again and again
-->graphics context

Xlib: GC structure
      stored on the x server
      global to the application(need policy)

What happens if the window minimize?
-everything disappaers
-soln: painter's algorithm
-note: repaint when necessary(e.g. before client-init)
       minimize the time of XFlush

Events Method
-ambiguity(continue from slide 27)
