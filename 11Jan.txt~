Basic X windows programming

X windows:
1. X server 
- provide services for client application to render, draw, mesh, etc...

2. X lib
- client

some resources store on x server
x server batches messages (XFlush command push messages out)

Xlib
so that ppl can avoid reinventing wheels
no common look and feel when implementing with xlib
no GUI toolkits --> flexible

client-init events: user inits ??? e.g. mouse click,move, keyboard events...

':0' -- open display
